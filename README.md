# Cookiecutter template for a Snakemake CLI

Based on [https://github.com/charlesreid1/2019-snakemake-cli](https://github.com/charlesreid1/2019-snakemake-cli).

However, many changes have been made to adjust to my working style with Snakemake and include more stuff for python packging.


## Usage

```bash
cookiecutter https://github.com/sschmeier/cookie-snakemake-cli.git
```

VERSION: VERSION: "0.2.0"
